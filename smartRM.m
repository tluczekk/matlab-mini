% Function smartRM calculates an integral of the function f on the interval
% [a, b] using the Romberg method of numerical integration. What makes it
% different however, is that it can stop when certain condition is smaller
% than a tolerance tol, specified in arguments. Function smartRM will do at
% least Kmin interpolation steps, and Kmax at maximum. Output variables are
% the result of the integration Q, err which is equal either to the value
% of aforementioned condition or to tol value, and K which indicates number
% of extrapolation steps performed.
